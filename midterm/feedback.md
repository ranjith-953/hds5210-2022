* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 30
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 9
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 0

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._

You forgot to include docstrings and tests throughout your code. I've deducted 10 points for the lack of documentation and test examples.


## Step 1
* Nice work. My only note is that your code for working through and calculating the average doesn't need to be in the `with` block. Your code is already done reading the input file as soon as `json.load()` completes.

## Step 2
* Nice work except the missing docstrings and tests.

## Step 3
* Rather than repeating all of the code from step 2, this function should have just called `get_rate()`. I deducted 1 point from _Good Practices_ for this.

## Step 4
I don't see a working solution for part 4. I've had to deduct 10 points for that missing solution.
