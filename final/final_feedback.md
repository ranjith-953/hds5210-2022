# Feedback on Final

Great work on the final project. You were very thorough in your analysis of the data and very clear in your explanation of what you were doing and interpretation of what you saw.

My only criticism is of your use of variable names like `df1`, `df2`, `df3`, etc. These are very hard to understand when looking at the code. My brain has to do extra work to try to remember what `df1` refers to, and it shouldn't have to.  You did this broadly throughout the final.
